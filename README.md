## GameBoy emulator

A Gameboy emulator written in Swift.  Most of the inspiration to do this was based on javidx9's awesome YouTube series for creating a NES emulator in C (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nViZg02IMQo&list=PLrOv9FMX8xJHqMvSGB_9G9nZZ_4IgteYf).

You can run this from Xcode.  Be sure to select the Release scheme or it will run too slowly.

## Keys

- Space - run / pause the emulator

- Enter - Start button
- Tab   - Select button
- Z     - B button
- X     - A button

- 1 - toggle display of CPU registers
- 2 - toggle display of Disassembly
- 3 - toggle display of tilesets
- 4 - toggle display of Tile Map + sprites + window (note that this displays in the same place as the main GB screen so you might want to toggle that off when you display this)
- 5 - toggle display of main Gameboy screen
- 6 - toggle mini-display of main Gameboy screen (usefull when Tile Map is displayed)

- D - reload disassembly
